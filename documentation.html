                <h3>BUILDING SAKURA</h3>
                Here we will guide you on how to build Project Sakura for your device.
                <h3>HOW TO SETUP A BUILD ENVIRONMENT</h3>
                To Build Project Sakura you can use any 64 Bit Linux Distro, though we recommend using Ubuntu 18.04, LinuxMint, MXLinux or Manjaro. You can setup the build environment using Akhil Narang's Script
                <pre class="copyable">git clone https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts; cd scripts; sudo bash setup/android_build_env.sh</pre>
                
                Or You can install all the packages manually using the commands below.

                <pre class="copyable">sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf libsdl1.2-dev libesd0-dev squashfs-tools build-essential zip curl libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk pngcrush schedtool libxml2 libxml2-utils xsltproc lzop libc6-dev schedtool g++-multilib lib32z1-dev lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline-gplv2-dev gcc-multilib maven tmux screen w3m ncftp</pre>
                
                <h3>SYNCING SOURCES</h3>
                To Sync ProjectSakura Sources you will need to execute the following command
                (PS: This command will shallow sync the sources which saves bandwidth and storage space if you are just going to build and not do any source side changes.)
                <pre class="copyable">repo init --depth=1 -u git://github.com/ProjectSakura/android.git -b 11 && repo sync --current-branch --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags --optimized-fetch --prune -j `nproc`</pre>
                <h3>BUILDING SAKURA</h3>
                Now execute the below command to start building ProjectSakura, replace "devicecodename" with your device's code. E.g, for ASUS ZENFONE MAX PRO M1 we will write X00T.
                <pre class="copyable">. build/envsetup.sh && lunch lineage_devicecodename-userdebug && mka bacon -jx</pre>
            </div>

            <div id="flags" class="content" style="display:none;">

                <h3>INSTALLING SAKURA</h3>
                This article only cover universal steps that you need to take and things may differ for every device so it's better if you also follow the XDA thread for your device.
                <br>
                <h3>DOWNLOAD PROJECT SAKURA</h3>
                To flash ProjectSakura you will need to get the flashable ROM zip for your device. We have a download center where you can get builds for every device that we support, Go to <a href="https://projectsakura.xyz/download">ProjectSakura | Downloads </a>
                <br><br>
                If you cannot find the build for your device on our download center then it probably is unsupported by us.
                <pre class="copyable">Note: Some devices also need specific firmwares and Vendors to be flashed with ROM. To know more you should check the XDA thread or Telegram Chats of your device.</pre>
                <h3>FLASHING PROJECT SAKURA</h3>
                After you have downloaded all the needed files, you can proceed with the flashing process. Boot your device into recovery mode and go to advanced wipe after that wipe dalvik, cache, system, vendor and data.
                <br><br>
                Once you have wiped, flash the required firmware / vendor zips and the flashable ROM zip. Then reboot to system and enjoy a clean Android experience.
                <br><br>
                <pre class="copyable">Note: ProjectSakura provides three types of builds GAPPS, VANILLA and MICROG. You may or maynot need to flash a separate GAPPS package depending on the type of the build; maintainer is releasing.</pre>
                <h3>GAINING ROOT ACCESS</h3>
                You will need to flash Magisk in order to gain root access. You can download the flashable magisk zip from it's Github Repo. We only recommend you to download magisk from verified sources.

                <h3>APPLY FOR PROJECT SAKURA MAINTAINERSHIP </h3>
                In this article we will tell you how you can become an Official ProjectSakura Maintainer.

                <h3>GUIDELINES</h3>
                You don't need too many skills to be a device maintainer. Though you need to fullfill these simple guidelines.
                <pre class="copyable">
1. You must own the device. You can maintain the device that have minimal hardware difference and use common trees with your device. BLIND building is absolutely NOT allowed.

2. You must know Basic git ( creating pull requests, properly writing commits, cherry-picking and other basic stuff).

3. You must have made some contributions towards your device community instead of just taking a device tree and compiling.

4. You must know how to read basic logcats.

5. You must have to compile Unofficial builds before you apply for Official. Do NOT apply as soon as you built an unofficial build and instead maintain it for a period of 2 months. Applying before you have even built will lead to instant rejection and we will blacklist you in our database.

6. Co-Maintaining is allowed but you cannot be a shadow maintainer for some other guy.
                </pre>
                You will recieve an email or Telegram message if we acknowledge your application. In some cases we may talk to you for some period of time to decide if we should accept or reject your application.
